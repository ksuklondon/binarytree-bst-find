# BinaryTree
Implementation of BST tree (Binary Search Tree).

The solution consist of projects:
* _BinarySearchTreeLib_ - library containing `BinarySearchTree` class,
* _BinarySearchTreeUnitTest_ - unit test for `BinarySearchTree` class,
* _BinarySearchTreeApp_ - application for checking the complexity of the search operation - `find` method.

## Task: BinaryTree-BST-find
Implement `BinarySearchTree` `find` methods that looks for a key with the given value.
